# Binary search

## Problem:

You are given a sorted array of integers in ascending order.
Your task is to implement a function that uses the binary search algorithm
to find a specific element in the array. The function should return the index
of the element if it is present in the array, or -1 if the element is not
present.

## Input:

A sorted array of integers in ascending order.
An integer representing the element to be searched.
## Output:

The index of the element in the array if it is present.
-1 if the element is not present in the array.

## Example:
```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 5
Output: 4
```
```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 10
Output: -1
```
